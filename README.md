## Webshop Next.js — Figma-driven build

Implements the Ecommerce wireframe from Figma with Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS v4, and public product APIs (DummyJSON/FakeStore).

### Development Approach

This project relied heavily on AI for code generation from the Figma design. However, the results were often inconsistent, requiring significant human intervention to correct errors and ensure the design was followed. This shows that while AI can speed things up, it often falls short without careful human oversight.

**Key Takeaways:**

- AI struggles with accurate design implementation
- Human review is crucial to fix AI-generated mistakes
- The process can be frustrating and time-consuming
